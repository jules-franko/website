		Welcome to my personal site. It doesn't really serve any purpose except to fill with random stuff I think is cool. 
		I am a student from the western United States and some of my interests are geopolitics, video games, language learning, technology and programming. 
		I speak English and like to study Spanish. I am also really interested in computers, software, and operating systems. I especially like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/incorrect-quotation.html">GNU/Linux</a>, and I usually switch between the Arch, Void, and Artix distributions. 
		I'm also interested in and an enthusiast of the free software movement and internet privacy. 
		I have a hard on for 2000s nostalgia, old software design, and internet/computing history and aesthetics.
		</p>

		<p>
		This website design is inspired by the tty on GNU/Linux even though it strays a little bit. I also got a ton of inspiration for the general layout and idea from my friend <a href="https://atlas999.neocities.org/">atlas</a>.
		I also have several old homepages, it was a little hard to ditch the frickin epic frutigeraerinos homepage but it was very messy and difficult to actually put information on easily.
		<a href="old/index.html">old pages</a> This page should be mostly clean of javascript but I can't make any promises because the programmer's original sin still taunts me.

		software I Use:
		<br>
		<a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">suckless dwm</a>
		- A minimalistic tiling window manager written in C. After I configured this to my liking it's hard to use anything else on my computer.
		<br>
		<a href="https://www.palemoon.org/">palemoon</a>
		- This is a free software fork of firefox which became it's own browser. I like it because it has an older looking UI.
		<br>
		<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">firefox</a>
		- because monopolies are bad 'n shit.
		<br>
		<a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a>
		- This is a minimal video player that pairs nicely with dwm. Lua scripts can be used to extend it's functionality to do a lot of cool things.
		<br>
		<a href="https://www.musicpd.org/">mpd</a>
		- The "Music Player Daemon" is what I use to listen to music from my local collection.
		<br>
		</p>

		<p>
		cool things i wanna share with the class:
		<br>
		<a href="https://protoweb.org/">protoweb</a>
		- A community project to host old versions of internet websites. (You can use firefox for this).
