            It's being invaded by the Otherworld. <br>
            By a world of someone's nightmarish delusions come to life. <br>
            I don't know what kind of hell is waiting for me there, but I've got no other choice. <br>
            I don't care about God or Paradise... If that's what she believes in then fine. <br>
            But she won't get away with what she did. <br>
            When I find her, I'll kill her myself.<br>
