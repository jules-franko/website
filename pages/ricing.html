        I have an unhealthy obsession with 'ricing' my desktop, so I figured it probably deserves its own page. You might already know what that is, but if you don't, its basically the concept of decorating your computer.
        It's a pretty common practice on *NIX systems but you can even do it on windows and macOS with enough effort.
        The name comes from asian street racers who would trick out their cars to make them look cooler. Ignore the slightly racist name because it's all in good fun.

        This is my dwm 'rice' at the time of writing this, although I can guarantee you it probably changed at least a little like 2 days after.
        It has gotten to the point where it has honestly become neurotic and I think I am actually going backwards in terms of aesthetic value but it's okay.

        here are some cool resources for ricing your computer:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">desktop threads on /g/</a> - I find this is the place where the most inspired desktops are, so maybe come check it out, or maybe don't...</li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">r/unixporn on r*ddit</a> - be warned most of what's posted here sucks but I can't judge too much because my desktop used to be like this too.
            nonetheless it's probably the best place to go if you wan't to give this a shot.</li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://www.trinitydesktop.org/">Trinity Desktop Environment</a> - This is a desktop environment which is a fork of an old version of KDE. It features a lot of older UI design and it's very nice
            to use if you are into that kind of thing. Shoutout to <a href="https://atlas999.neocities.org">atlas</a> for showing me this.</li>
        </ul>
