            <h3>Minecraft</h3>

                <a>Minecraft</a> is in my opinion, by far the best video game ever created.
                I'm not sure if it's objectively better than other videogames, but
                it's certainly my personal favorite. There is no videogame more shrouded
                in nostalgia and good memories than Minecraft. I'm sure anyone else who is 
                gen-z or millenial aged can agree to this.

                The soundtrack by <a>C418</a> is a masterpiece and it's enough to bring any 
                grown man who grew up playing this game to tears. The art and the sounds 
                all feel perfect in their own way. The gameplay is open ended but structured enough that it left you and your friends a lot to do. The game is very relaxed and easy to jump into at any given moment without any kind of goal in mind, but it still retains plenty of complexity. Some people have pointed out the weak points of Minecraft, such as the repetitive gameplay loop or the lack of a real goal. I don't know how valid these criticisms are but I have personally spent an ungodly amount of time playing this game throughout my life and most of it was fun. So I feel like I have at least some jurisdiction to say the gameplay is good.

                My favorite versions of minecraft were anything from the beta to java <a>1.12</a>. I 
                did not play the beta version of the java edition of the game during its 
                prime, but I did play the lite and pocket editions which were similar in
                terms of their feature sets and general aesthetics. I think the game is still
                great today but it has admittetly lost some of it's original charm. 
                In my opinion the biggest change from these earlier versions of Minecraft to the
                newer versions is the updated world generation. It was changed a few times but 
                the newest iterations feel empty and devoid of interesting structures. 
                I often find myself in locations that feel exactly the same. The older versions of the game had very strange and unique world generation that led to very memorable worlds. <a>1.13</a>, the aquatic update, was also the beginning of many updates which didn't feel the same as the 
                old ones did.

                I'm not arguing they are objectively worse in any way, they are
                still fun. I understand the developers don't want the game to get boring so they need to add new things to keep the community living and I'm not hating on them. They have added lots of interesting features to the game that give you way more
                things to do (<a href="../images/agnes2.gif">Agnes Larsson</a> please notice me). I just have a special place in my heart for the versions before 1.13.

                You heard it here first folks, <a>everything</a> was 
                better when I was there and worse when I wasn't<sup>TM</sup>.

                I am also not a fan of the <a class="evil">bedrock</a> version of the game at all. It has
                microtransactions, horrible optimization, emotes, and different redstone mechanics than the PC version. I sincerely hope <a class="evil">Microsoft</a> does not do away with the Java edition to replace it with bedrock, although the last I heard this seemed to be the long term plan. May <a class="link-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson">Notch</a> save us.

                All in all, this is truly the best game ever made and considering the fact
                that it is the best selling videogame of all time and a massive cultural phenomeon, it seems like a lot of other people agree.
