            <h3>Silent Hill 3</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                My other favorite videogame other than </a href="minecraft.html">Minecraft</a> is <a>Silent Hill 3</a>. My first Silent Hill game was the second one, and at first that was my favorite, but as time went on I came to like the third game better. It has an atmosphere unlike any other videogame I have played, the art and aesthetic appeal is perfect, it's subtle, makes itself interesting, and it's also genuinely pretty scary. Overall it just feels high quality and well crafted. Silent Hill 3 has attached itself to me and I have continued to grow an appreciation for it since. I'm not really a hardcore gamer and I don't enjoy that many videogames but something about this one is just how I feel videogames should present themselves.

                It's also worth mentioning <a>Heather Mason</a>, the protagonist of this game, is my favorite Silent Hill character. All of the original 4 game's characters are good but she feels much more human-like. James was admittetly more pyschologicallyy interesting but heather just adds a lot of personality to the whole thing. <a>Don't you think blondes have more fun?</a>

                You probably don't really care to hear my personal review of the game though (even though you just did). However, if you are interested in it, I would recommend checking out a <a class="evil">youtube</a> channel called <a class="link-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/@lyingfigure5811">Lying Figure</a>. His channel description is just "I love Silent Hill" (me too brother). Watch his "lore-plays" where he will play through the entire game, show you every area, every hidden nod, explain all of the story, references, facts about development, etc.
