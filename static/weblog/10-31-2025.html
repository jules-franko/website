        I remember coming across a small website who's entire purpose was to demonstrate the amazing efficiency of plain <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. It made me realize how little I appreciated it in the past, so I am making this page in honor of it. There are a lot of reasons to use less CSS/Javascript on a webpage.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Looks the same on any browser (terminal or graphical).</li>
        <li>Is very lightweight.</li>
        <li>Emphasizes a focus on page content, and doesn't compensate with flashy decorations.</li>
        <li>Is extremely easy to write.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The internet is older than I am so I never experienced any webpages like this until discovering the indie web. CSS is great and it's half of what makes the web fun (at least in my opinion). However, pages with no CSS are a lot cooler than I thought. Thanks HTML.
